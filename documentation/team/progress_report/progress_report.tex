\section{Project Purpose and Goals}
The overall goal of our project is to design a new workflow system for printing multicolored 3D representations of molecules, specifically biomolecules such as proteins and DNA structures. The existing workflow system for creating models of biomolecules in the OSU Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics consists of printing of a white object and painting it by hand. This is of course a slow and inefficient use time and teaching resources.\par 
This problem will be addressed by implementing a 3D printing system that makes use of multiple colored filaments, in our case up to four different colors, that creates a multi-colored object. Our solution will need to make use of the Mosaic Manufacturing Palette+, open source or freely available software tools, and custom algorithms and or programs to create an appropriately tailored and streamlined workflow.\par
At the end of the project we plan to have a workflow system that will allow a worker who has a basic knowledge of 3D printing to create a multi-colored object just as easily as a monochrome object.\par

\section{Current Status of Project}
At the end of the fall term we have completed the large majority of the required project documentation including the problem statement, the requirements document, the technology review, the design document, and this progress report. Each group member has also kept weekly blog updates during the past ten weeks with details about their accomplishments and contributions to the project throughout the term.\par

\section{Problems that Have Impeded Progress}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item\textbf{Palette+ Servicing:} At this point in time the major problem for our project is our lack of access to the Palette+. It is currently being serviced by the manufacturer and we are expecting to receive it before the start of the Winter term.
    \item\textbf{Learning \LaTeX:} At the start of the term none of the group members were familiar with the use of \LaTeX. Throughout the course of the term the group members gained experience using \LaTeX and also encountered new problems. Many of these issues were solved by looking up documentation as well as collaborating to find a solution to a specific problem. 
	\end{enumerate}

    The group completed and submitted all assignments on time. & 
    Instructor feedback on documents would be beneficial. & 
    Complete drafts of documents before the due date, so that instructor feedback can be requested.

     \hline
    The group was able to work independently and produce satisfactory work without asking much from the client. & 
    Next term, when we are more in the development phase, to ensure the project is on track, more client meetings should be held. & 
    Schedule regular meetings with the client, at least once every other week.
